          I am Ivy Logatoc, a 3rd year college student at Marinduque State College taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Systems.I am enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.

Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in academics but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. I am a soft hearted person but I dont cry easily. "Miracle is another name for hardwork" is my motto in life. Someday I want to be a successful Project Manager or Web developer.
